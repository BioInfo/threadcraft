## Decision

* 2025-07-31 07:01:19 - Initialize Memory Bank and seed from ThreadCraft_PRD.md

## Rationale 

* Maintain durable, cross-mode project context and ensure PRD insights are reflected in working artifacts without re-reading the PRD each time.

## Implementation Details

* Created memory-bank/ directory with:
  - productContext.md (seeded from PRD)
  - activeContext.md (current focus and questions)
  - progress.md (task tracking)
  - decisionLog.md (this file)
  - systemPatterns.md (to be initialized next)
<!-- 2025-07-31 07:25:02 - Set Memory Bank status to ACTIVE and synchronized all files -->
